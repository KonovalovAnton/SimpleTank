#Welcome to the SimpleTank wiki!

Hey you my guest!

This is a tiny project I've made in 4 hours to share some source code of mine with the world. This is more about Component Oriented Programming, but I'm doing OOP as well (not today). Do not judge strictly :)

The project structure has sort of brain damage, because I put source code of the scene in separate folder and the other scripts are inside the prefabs folders (fitted good for a 30 lines of code game).

Thanks internet for the art I found.

Go ahead and try out game first https://github.com/KonovalovAnton/SimpleTank/wiki/Project-info
